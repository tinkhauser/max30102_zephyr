    default: 0
    description: |
      To reduce the amount of data throughput, adjacent samples (in each
      individual channel) can be averaged and decimated on the chip by
      setting this register. Set to 0 for no averaging.
    enum:
      - 0 # 1 sample (no averaging)
      - 1 # 2 samples
      - 2 # 4 samples
      - 3 # 8 samples
      - 4 # 16 samples
      - 5 # 32 samples
  fifo-rollover-en:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Controls the behavior of the FIFO when the FIFO becomes completely
      filled with data. If true, the FIFO address rolls over to zero and the
      FIFO continues to fill with new data. If false, then the FIFO is
      not updated until FIFO_DATA is read or the WRITE/READ pointer
      positions are changed.
  fifo-a-full:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: |
      Set the trigger for the FIFO_A_FULL interrupt.

      heart-rate-mode is red LED only
      spo2-mode is red and IR LEDs
      multi-led-mode is red and/or IR LEDs

    description: | 
      Set the effective sampling rate with one sample consisting of one
      pulse/conversion per active LED channel. In SpO2 mode, these means
      one IR pulse/conversion and one red pulse/conversion per sample
      period.
